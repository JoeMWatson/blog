I'm a PhD student in the Intelligent Autonomous Systems group at TU Darmstadt, supervised by Prof. Jan Peters.

I'm interested in the dualities between inference and control, with the aim of using methods from approximate inference to design principled algorithms that enable robots to learn sensorimotor skills from experience.
